# Task №2
1. Develop yourself using numpy library: 
    - a function to implement gradient descent (GD) algorithm 
    - Adam's optimization algorithm 

for a function of two variables f(x,y).

2. Come up with a function of two variables of an arbitrary form and implement the search for its minimum using those implemented in p.1 functions - a) and b).
3. Illustrate the process of finding an extremum in the form of a graph of the dependence of the value of the difference between two successive approximations of the solution (x_next – x_prev) on the iteration number N.
