# Task â„–1:
1. Train 4 different classifiers using sklearn library to predict "Activity" (biological response of the molecule) field from the "bioresponse.csv" dataset:
    - small decision tree;
    - deep decision tree;
    - random forest on small trees;
    - random forest on deep trees;
2. Calculate the following metrics to check the quality of your models:
    - precision;
    - recall;
    - accuracy;
    - F1-score;
    - log-loss;
3. Plot precision-recall and ROC curves for your models.
4. Train a classifier who avoids Type II (False Negative) errors and calculate metrics  from p.2 for it.
