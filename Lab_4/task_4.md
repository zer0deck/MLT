# Task 4:
1.	Download Alice in Wonderland by Lewis Carroll from Project Gutenberg's website http://www.gutenberg.org/files/11/11-0.txt
2.	Perform any necessary preprocessing on the text, including converting to lower case, removing stop words, numbers / non-alphabetic characters, lemmatization.
3.	Find Top 10 most important (for example, in terms of TF-IDF metric) words from each chapter in the text (not "Alice"); how would you name each chapter according to the identified tokens?
4.	Find the Top 10 most used verbs in sentences with Alice. What does Alice do most often?
5.	*(not necessary) Find Top 100 most used verbs in sentences with Alice. Get word vectors using a pre-trained word2vec model and visualize them. Compare the words using embeddings.
